# Wizard-C-Sharp-Game

A simple wizard battle game where two wizards fight based on attributes like Health, Wisdom, Dexterity, and Element (Air, Water, Earth, Fire). Each wizard's attack is influenced by elemental advantages (e.g., Fire beats Air, Water beats Fire), and the first player to reduce the opponent's health to zero wins.

Features:
- Elemental Advantage: Certain elements deal extra damage to others.
- Turn-based Combat: The wizard with higher dexterity attacks first.
- Randomized Stats: AI wizard's stats (Health, Wisdom, Dexterity) are randomly generated.
- Health & Progress Bars: Visual feedback of health status using progress bars.
- MessageBox Winner: Displays the winner when a wizard's health reaches zero.

Used:
- C# (Windows Forms)
